Interaction Framework Overview

The OpenSpan Interaction Framework is the foundation for all Agile Desktop projects. This framework lets multiple projects interact with one another without direct dependencies. Using the Interaction Framework, you can define a shared set of data and activities known as an interaction. All of the projects in the solution can then use this interaction.

Using the framework, you can add new projects to a solution to satisfy a new business requirements without having to modify existing projects. Having interactions already defined makes the coding of projects more efficient and lets you deploy projects more quickly. It also let you test projects independently, which can improve quality.

Using the Interaction Framework...

Improves reusability by creating a data and activity contract between projects

Eliminates direct dependencies

Queues activities to simplify threading and state management during automations

Separates configuration and user interface from coding when used with the Agile Desktop Framework

Lets you quickly add new projects to address business requirements without updating existing projects

Lets you focus on automation and not configuration, user interface, or threading

Lets you build and test projects more efficiently by reducing dependencies between projects

Lets you systematically iterate existing automations to morph as business requirements change

Improves quality by eliminating complex tasks and reducing manual activities

When used with OpenSpan Management Console, Interaction Framework lets you deliver a powerful resource foundation that increases development efficiency and provides fast, easy deployment of automation and Agile Desktop projects within your enterprise.
